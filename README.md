# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Descriptions
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data
that can be used for later analysis.

## What to submit
* a tidy data set
* a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
* a code book (CodeBook.md) that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
* also include README.md in the repo with your scripts. It explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
